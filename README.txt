This project requires weka.jar and StudentFilters.jar to run. They are included in the git repo.

Each of the sections of the project are relegated to a method with the name doExperiment# where
# is the number of the step. To run the program uncomment the step you want to run in the main
method of the Main class. Many doExperiment methods output a lot of text into the console so, if 
that is the case, I would recommend that you comment out parts of the method and run it in parts.
